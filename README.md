## Design Process

The first thing I did was start a Trello board that would be added to and editted throughout the design and coding processes. At the moment of writing, this is what it looks like:

I then went to Pinterest to start collecting inspirational images for my mood board. I kept my coded art at the back of my mind as I knew I wanted to use them as decorations.
